# BCD-Tool
We have created a model that outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for breast cancer image classification.
This is an upublished project at the time but we provide our source code for learning purposes only. The histopatholgical images used for training and testing are 
not included here because of the huge size but we can provide them upon a resonable request. In case of any confusion, querry, collaboration, or suggestions, please
please feel free to reach out at aamirmehmood@sjtu.edu.cn. We will provide more updates once the project is published. Thank you for your interest.
