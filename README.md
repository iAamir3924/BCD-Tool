# BCD-Tool
We have created a model that accurately predicts for breast cancer using image numerical data.
This is an upublished project at the time but we provide our source code for learning purposes only. The histopatholgical images used for training and testing are 
not included here because of the huge size but we can provide them upon a resonable request. In case of any confusion, querry, collaboration, or suggestions, please
please feel free to reach out at aamirmehmood@sjtu.edu.cn. We will provide more updates once the project is published. Thank you for your interest.

**Please use the bestmodelbrcimage951.ipynb file and cleaned_balanced_dataset.csv for running.**
